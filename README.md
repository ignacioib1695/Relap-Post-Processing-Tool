# Relap-Post-Processing-Tool

There are four files that must be in the same path for the python script to work. The first one, called "Dyn_NC.i" is the input for RELAP. Then, "corre.bat" is an executable used to run RELAP. On the other hand, there is a matlab data file with experimental data, which must be keep also in the same path as the rest of the files. Finally, the script implemented in python is in the file "PythonProjectDinasty.ipynb".

In addition to these files, it is necesary to have a folder with the license of the program, that will be send by email but that must not be upload here.

A detailed description can be founded in the python script.
